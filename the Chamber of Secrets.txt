HARRY: I can’t let you out, Hedwig. I’m not allowed to use magic outside of school. Besides, if Uncle Vernon-
UNCLE VERNON: Harry Potter!
HARRY: Now you’ve done it.
AUNT PETUNIA: He’s in there. Vernon...
UNCLE VERNON: I’m warning you, if you can’t control that bloody bird it’ll have to go.
HARRY: But she’s bored! If I could only let out for an hour or two-
UNCLE VERNON: Huh, huh! So you could send secret messages to you freaky little friends. No, sir!
HARRY: But I haven’t had any messages from any of my friends... not one... all summer.
DUDLEY: Who’d want to be friends with you?
UNCLE VERNON: I should think you’d be a little more grateful. We’ve raised you since you were a baby, given you the food off our table, even let you have Dudley’s second bedroom, purely out of the goodness of our hearts.
AUNT PETUNIA: Not now, Bopkins. For when the Masons arrive.
UNCLE VERNON: Which should be any minute! Ahem...Now let’s go over our schedule once again, shall we? Petunia when the Masons arrive you will be...?
AUNT PETUNIA: ...in the lounge, waiting to welcome them graciously into our home.
UNCLE VERNON: Good! And- and Dudley, you will be...?
DUDLEY: I’ll be waiting to open the door!
UNCLE VERNON: Excellent! ...And you...?
HARRY: I’ll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending that I don’t exist.
UNCLE VERNON: Too right, you will. With any luck, this could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career. And you will not mess it up!

HARRY: Who are you?
DOBBY: Dobby sir, Dobby the house elf.
HARRY: Not to be to be rude or anything, but this isn’t a great time for me to have a house elf in my bedroom.
DOBBY: Oh, oh yes, sir! Dobby understands! It’s just that, Dobby has come to tell you- it is difficult, sir- Dobby wonders where to begin?
HARRY: Why don’t you sit down?
DOBBY: S-sit down? S-sit- sit down? Oh, oh, ho. Oh, ho, ho... Oh, ho, ho. Ohh, ho, hoo...
HARRY: Dobby, ssh! I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to offend you, or anything.
DOBBY: Offend Dobby? Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but never has he been asked to sit down by a wizard, like an equal.
HARRY: You can’t have met many decent wizards then.
DOBBY: No, I haven’t. That was an awful thing to say. Bad Dobby!

HARRY: Your family?
DOBBY: The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. Dobby is bound to serve one family forever. If they ever knew Dobby was here...ooh... But Dobby had to come. Dobby has to protect Harry Potter- to warn him. Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year! There is a plot, a plot to make most terrible things happen.
HARRY: What terrible things? Who’s plotting them?
DOBBY: Ooo... er... can’t... say... argh...

DOBBY: Don’t make me talk, I— Errr...

HARRY: Get in there, and keep quiet!
UNCLE VERNON: What the devil are you doing up here?
HARRY: I- I was just—
UNCLE VERNON: You just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke!
HARRY: Sorry.
UNCLE VERNON: One more sound, and you’ll wish you’d never been born, boy! And fix that door!
HARRY: Yes, sir... See why I’ve got to go back? I don’t belong here. I belong in your world, at Hogwarts. It’s the only place I’ve got friends!
DOBBY: Friends who don’t even write to Harry Potter?
HARRY: Well, I expect they’ve... been- hang on- how do you know my friends haven’t been writing to me?
DOBBY: Harry Potter mustn’t be angry with Dobby. Heh- Dobby hoped, if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him, Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir.

DOBBY: (Snap!)

GEORGE: Yeah, Mum would never know.
RON: It’s not much, but it’s home.
HARRY: I think it’s brilliant
MRS. WEASLEY: Where have you been? Harry, how wonderful to see you dear. Beds empty! No note! Car gone! You could have died! You could have been seen! Of course, I don’t blame you, Harry dear.
RON: They were starving him, Mum. There were bars on his window!
MRS. WEASLEY: Well, you’d best hope that I don’t put bars on your window, Ronald Weasley! Come on Harry, time for a spot of breakfast. Here we are Harry. Now tuck in! That’s it. There we go.
GINNY: Mum- Mummy, have you seen my jumper?
MRS. WEASLEY: Yes dear. It was on the cat.
HARRY: Hello. W-what did I do?

MRS. WEASLEY: Morning Arthur!
ARTHUR WEASLEY: What a night. Nine raids. Nine!
HARRY: Raids?
RON: Dad works in the Ministry of Magic, in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office. Dad loves Muggles, thinks they’re fascinating.
ARTHUR WEASLEY: Well now. Aah! And who are you?
HARRY: Oh, sorry sir. I’m Harry, sir, Harry Potter.
ARTHUR WEASLEY: Good Lord! Are you really? Well, Ron’s told us all about you, of course. When did he get here?
MRS. WEASLEY: This morning. Your sons flew that enchanted car of yours to Surrey and back last night.
ARTHUR WEASLEY: Did you really? How’d it go? Did you—
FRED, GEORGE, RON, HARRY: Oh, it...
MRS. WEASLEY: Arthur!
ARTHUR WEASLEY: I mean...that was very wrong, indeed, boys. Very wrong of you. Now, Harry, you must know all about Muggles. Tell me, what exactly is the function of a rubber duck?
HARRY: Oh, umm...
MRS. WEASLEY: Well, that’ll be Errol with the post. Oh, fetch it will you Percy, please?
PERCY: Errol...
RON: He’s always doing that.
PERCY: Oh look, it’s our Hogwarts letters. And they’ve sent us Harry’s as well.
ARTHUR WEASLEY: Dumbledore must know you’re here, Harry. Doesn’t miss a trick, that man.
MRS. WEASLEY: Oh, no.
FRED: This lot won’t come cheap, Mum. The spell books alone are very expensive.
MRS. WEASLEY: We’ll manage. There’s only one place we’re going to get all of this. Diagon Alley.

RON: Diagon Alley!
MRS. WEASLEY: You see? It’s quite easy, dear. Don’t be afraid. Come on. Come on. In you go. That’s it, mind your head. That’s right. Now take your Floo powder. That’s it, very good. Now, don’t forget to speak very, very clearly.

OTHER: Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart.
MRS. WEASLEY: Ah! Here he is!
RON: Mum fancies him.
PHOTOGRAPHER: Make way there. Please! Let me by, madam. Thank you. Excuse me, little girl. This is for the Daily Prophet.
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: It can’t be- Harry Potter?
PHOTOGRAPHER: Harry Potter! Excuse me, madam.
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Nice big smile, Harry. Together you and I rate the front page! Ladies and gentlemen, what an extraordinary moment this is. When young
Harry stepped into Flourish and Blotts this morning to purchase my autobiography, Magical Me,... which, incidentally is currently celebrating its 27th week atop the Daily Prophet bestseller list, he had no idea that he would, in fact, be leaving... with my entire collected works, free of charge. Now, ladies?
MRS. WEASLEY: Harry, now you give me those, and I’ll get them signed. All of you wait outside. That’s it, Ron.
DRACO: I’ll bet you loved that, didn’t you, Potter? Famous Harry Potter! Can’t even go into a bookshop without making the front page.
GINNY: Leave him alone.
DRACO: Oh look, Potter. You’ve got yourself a girlfriend.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Now, now Draco, play nicely. Mr. Potter... Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last. Forgive me, your scar is legend, as, of course, is the wizard who gave it to you.
HARRY: Voldemort killed my parents. He was nothing more than a murderer.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Hmm. You must be very brave, to mention his name...or very foolish.
HERMIONE: Fear of a name only increase fear of the thing itself.
LUCIUS MALFOY: And you must be... Miss Granger. Yes, Draco’s told me all about you, and your parents. Muggles, aren’t they? Let me see...red hair... vacant expressions... tatty second hand book. You must be the Weasleys.
ARTHUR WEASLEY: Children, it’s mad in here! Let’s go outside.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Well, well, well. Weasley senior.
ARTHUR WEASLEY: Lucius.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur, all those extra raids? I do hope they’re paying you overtime, but judging by the state of this, I’d say not. What’s the use in being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don’t even pay you well for it.
ARTHUR WEASLEY: We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Clearly. Associating with Muggles... and I thought your family could sink no lower. I’ll see you at work.
DRACO: See you at school.

SNAPE: You were seen by no less than seven Muggles. Do you have any idea how serious this is? You have risked the exposure of our world. Not to mention the damage you inflicted on a Whomping Willow that’s been on these grounds since before you were born.
RON: Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us.
SNAPE: Silence! I assure you, that were you in Slytherin, and your fate rested with me, the both of you would be on the train home- tonight. As it is...
DUMBLEDORE: ...They are not.
HARRY: Professor Dumbledore. Professor McGonagall.
SNAPE: Headmaster, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry. As such--
DUMBLEDORE: I am well aware of our bylaws, Severus, having written quite a few of them myself. However, as head of Gryffindor house, it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action.
RON: We’ll go and get our stuff, then.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: What are you talking about, Mr. Weasley?
RON: You’re going to expel us, aren’t you?
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Not today, Mr. Weasley. But, I must impress on both of you the seriousness of what you have done. I will be writing to your families tonight, and you will both receive detention.

PROFESSOR SPROUT: Welcome to Greenhouse Three, Second Years. Now, gather around, everyone. Today, we are going to repot Mandrakes. Who here can tell me the properties of the Mandrake root? Yes, Miss Granger.
HERMIONE: Mandrake, or Mandragora, is used to return those who have been Petrified to their original state. It’s also quite dangerous. The Mandrake’s cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.
PROFESSOR SPROUT: Excellent! Ten points to Gryffindor! Now, as our Mandrakes are still only seedlings their cries won’t kill you yet. But they could knock you out for several hours, which is why I have given each of you a pair of earmuffs for auditory protection. So, could you please put them on, right away? Quickly! Flaps tight down, and watch me closely. You grasp your Mandrake firmly, you pull it sharply up out of the pot...
All: Aah! Ooh!
PROFESSOR SPROUT: Got it? And... now you dunk it down into the other pot and pour a little sprinkling of soil to keep him warm.
NEVILLE: Uhh...
PROFESSOR SPROUT: Uh, Longbottom’s been neglecting his earmuffs.
SEAMUS: No, ma’am, he’s just fainted.

WOOD: I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.
MARCUS FLINT: Easy, Wood. I’ve got a note.
RON: Uh-oh. I smell trouble.
WOOD: “I, Professor Severus Snape, do hereby give the Slytherin team permission to practice today, owing to the need to train their new Seeker.” You’ve got a new Seeker. Who?
HARRY: Malfoy?
DRACO: That’s right. And that’s not all that new this year.
RON: Those are Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones! How did you get those?
MARCUS FLINT: A gift from Draco’s father.
DRACO: You see Weasley, unlike some, my father can afford the best.
HERMIONE: At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in. They got it on pure talent.
DRACO: No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood!
RON: You’ll pay for that one, Malfoy. Eat slugs!

HARRY: Malfoy. He called Hermione, ...um, well, I don’t- I don’t know exactly what it means.
HERMIONE: He called me a Mudblood.
HAGRID: He did not!
HARRY: What’s a Mudblood?
HERMIONE: It means “dirty blood.” Mudblood’s a really foul name for someone who is Muggle-born. Someone with non-magic parents. Someone like me. It’s not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation.
HAGRID: See, the thing is, Harry, there’re some wizards, like the Malfoy family, who think they’re better’n everyone else because they’re what people call “pure blood.”
HARRY: That’s horrible!
RON: (Blech...) It’s disgusting.
HAGRID: And it’s codswallop, to boot. “Dirty blood.” Why, there isn’t a wizard alive today that’s not half blood or less. More ter the point, they’ve yet to think of a spell that our Hermione can’ do. Come here... Don’t you think on it, Hermione. Don’t you think on it for one minute... eh?

OTHERS: (mumble, mumble) Ahhh! What’s that?
MADAME POMFREY: Oh!
DRACO: ‘Enemies of the heir beware!’ You’ll be next, Mudbloods!
FILCH: What’s going on ‘ere? Go on, make way, make way. Potter-- What are you...Mrs. Norris? You’ve...murdered my cat.
HARRY: No. No.
FILCH: I’ll kill ya... I’ll kill ya!
DUMBLEDORE: Argus! Argus, I... Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately. Everyone except... you three.
OTHER: Ravenclaws, follow me!
DUMBLEDORE: She’s not dead, Argus. She has been Petrified.
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Ah, thought so. So unlucky I wasn’t there. I know exactly the counter curse that could have spared her.
DUMBLEDORE: But how she has been Petrified, I cannot say...
FILCH: Ask him. It’s him who’s done it. You saw what he wrote on the wall.
HARRY: It’s not true sir, I swear. I never touched Mrs. Norris.
FILCH: Rubbish!
SNAPE: If I might, Headmaster? Perhaps Potter and his friends were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. However, the circumstances are suspicious. I, for one, don’t recall seeing Potter at dinner.
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: I’m afraid that’s my doing, Severus. You see, Harry was helping me answer my fan mail.
HERMIONE: That’s why Ron and I went looking for him, Professor. We’d just found him when he said...
SNAPE: Yes, Miss Granger?
HARRY: When I said I wasn’t hungry. We were heading back to the common room when we found Mrs. Norris.
DUMBLEDORE: Innocent until proven guilty, Severus.
FILCH: My cat has been Petrified. I wanna see some punishment!
DUMBLEDORE: We will be able to cure her, Argus. As I understand it, Madame Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrakes. When matured, a potion will be made which will revive Mrs. Norris. And in the meantime, I strongly recommend caution... to all.

HARRY: Do you think I should have told them? Dumbledore and the others, I mean?

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Could I have your attention, please? Right. Now, today, we will be transforming animals into water goblets. Like so. One, two, three, Vera verto. Now it’s your turn. Well, who would like to go first? Ah! Mr. Weasley. “One, two, three. Vera verto.”
RON: Ahem. Vera verto!
OTHERS: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha...
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: That wand needs replacing, Mr. Weasley. Yes, Miss Granger?
HERMIONE: Professor, I was wondering if you could tell us about...the Chamber of Secrets?
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Well, very well. Well, you all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. Now, three of the founders coexisted quite harmoniously. One did not.
RON: Three guesses who.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. In other words, “pure-bloods.” Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school. Now, according to legend, Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle, known as the Chamber of Secrets. Though, shortly before departing, he sealed it until that time when his own true heir returned to the school. The heir alone would be able to open the Chamber and unleash the horror within, and by so doing purge the school of all those who, in Slytherin’s view, were unworthy to study magic.
HERMIONE: Muggle-borns.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Well, naturally, the school had been searched many times. No such chamber has been found.
HERMIONE: Professor? What exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Well, the Chamber is said to home to something that only the Heir of Slytherin can control. It is said to be the home of a monster.

RON: D’you think it’s true? D’you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets?
HERMIONE: Yes. Couldn’t you tell? McGonagall’s worried. All the teachers are.
HARRY: Well, if there really is a Chamber of Secrets, a-and it really has been opened, then that means---
HERMIONE: The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?
RON: Let’s think. Who do we know who thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?
HERMIONE: If you’re talking about Malfoy-
RON: Of course. You heard him! ‘You’ll be next Mudbloods,’
HERMIONE: I heard him. But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?
HARRY: Well, maybe Ron’s right, Hermione. I mean, look at his family. The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries.
RON: Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe we could trick them into telling.
HERMIONE: Even they aren’t that thick. But there might be another way. Mind you, it would be difficult. Not to mention, we would be breaking about fifty school rules. And, it’ll be dangerous. Very dangerous.

HERMIONE: Here it is. ‘The Polyjuice Potion.’ (Reading from Moste Potente Potions) ‘Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another.’
RON: Do you mean, if Harry and I drink that stuff, we’ll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?
HERMIONE: Yes.
RON: Wicked! Malfoy’ll tell us anything.
HERMIONE: Exactly. But it’s tricky. I’ve never seen a more complicated potion.
HARRY: Well, how long will it take to make?
HERMIONE: A month.
HARRY: A month? But, Hermione, if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin, he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then.
HERMIONE: I know. But it’s the only plan we’ve got.

MADAME POMFREY: Oh, I’ll be able to, certainly. But it’ll be painful. You’re in for a rough night, Potter. Regrowing bones is a nasty business.

HARRY: It was you... You stopped the barrier from letting Ron and me through.
DOBBY: Indeed. Yes, sir.
HARRY: You nearly got Ron and me expelled!
DOBBY: At least you would be away from here. Harry Potter must go home! Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make Harry Potter see that---
HARRY: Your Bludger? You made that Bludger chase after me?
DOBBY: Uhuh... Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir. Dobby had to iron his hands.
HARRY: You’d better clear off before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you!
DOBBY: Uh-huh-huh... Dobby is used to death threats sir. Dobby gets them five times a day at home.
HARRY: I don’t suppose you could tell me why you’re trying to kill me?
DOBBY: Not kill you, sir, never kill you! Dobby remembers how it was before Harry Potter triumphed over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. We house elves were treated like vermin, sir. Of course, Dobby is still treated like vermin...uh, huh, huh, huh! Aah, ahh...
HARRY: Why do you wear that thing Dobby?
DOBBY: This, sir? It is a mark of the house-elves’ enslavement. Dobby can only be freed if his master presents him with clothes. Ah! Listen. Listen! Terrible things are about to happen at Hogwarts. Harry Potter must not stay here, now that history is to repeat itself.
HARRY: Repeat itself? You mean this has happened before?
DOBBY: Ah! I shouldn’t have said that! Oh! Ah! Dah! Bad Dobby! Bad!
HARRY: Dobby, stop it! Stop it! Stop, Dobby! Tell me, Dobby. When did this happen before? Who’s doing it now?
DOBBY: Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby only wants Harry Potter to be safe.
HARRY: No, Dobby. Tell me. Who is it?
DOBBY: (Snap!)
MADAME POMFREY: Put him here. What happened?
DUMBLEDORE: There’s been another attack.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: I think- do ya know- I think he’s been Petrified, Madame Pomfrey. Look! Perhaps he managed to take a picture of his attacker... (Poof)
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: What can this mean, Albus?
DUMBLEDORE: It means...that our students are in great danger.

HERMIONE: Moaning Myrtle.

myself have done on countless occasions- for full details, see my published works. Let me introduce my assistant, Professor Snape. He has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration. Now, I don’t want any of you youngsters to worry- you’ll still have your Potions master when I’m through with him, never fear. One, two, three-
SNAPE: Expelliarmus!
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Whoaah!
HERMIONE: Do you think he’s all right?
RON: Who cares?
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: An excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape, but if you don’t mind me saying, it was pretty obvious- ah- what you were about to do. And if I had wanted to stop you, it would have been only too easy.
SNAPE: Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students to block unfriendly spells, Professor.
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: An excellent suggestion, Professor Snape! Ah... Let’s have a volunteer pair! Um, Potter, Weasley, how about you?
SNAPE: Weasley’s wand causes devastation with the simplest spells. We’ll be sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox. Might I suggest someone from my own house? Malfoy, perhaps?
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Good luck, Potter.
HARRY: Thank you, sir.
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Wands at the ready.
DRACO: Scared, Potter?

HERMIONE: No, they can’t. It’s not a very common gift, Harry. This is bad.
HARRY: What’s bad? If I hadn’t told that snake not to attack Justin-
RON: Oh, that’s what you said to it!
HARRY: You were there! You heard me!
RON: I heard you speaking Parseltongue. Snake language?
HARRY: I spoke a different language? But- I didn’t realize I- how can I speak a language without knowing I can?
HERMIONE: I don’t know, Harry, but it sounded like you were egging the snake on, or something. Harry, listen to me. There’s a reason the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent. Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth. He could talk to snakes, too.
RON: Exactly! Now the whole school’s gonna think you’re his great- great- great grandson, or something.

RON (as CRABBE): Ahem...Stomachache.
DRACO: You know, I’m surprised that the Daily Prophet hasn’t done a report on all these attacks. I suppose Dumbledore is trying to hush it all up. Father always said Dumbledore was the worst thing that ever happened to this place.
HARRY (as GOYLE): You’re wrong!
DRACO: What? You think there’s someone here who’s worse than Dumbledore? Well? Do you?
HARRY (as GOYLE): Harry Potter? (gulp)
DRACO: Good one, Goyle. You’re absolutely right. Saint Potter. And people actually think that he’s the Heir of Slytherin!
HARRY (as GOYLE): But then you must have some idea who’s behind it all.
DRACO: You know I don’t Goyle. I told you yesterday. How many times do I have to tell you? Is this yours? But my father did say this: It’s been fifty years since the Chamber was opened. He wouldn’t tell me who opened it-- only that they were expelled. The last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died. So, it’s only a matter of time before one of them is killed this time. As for me, I hope it’s Granger. What’s the matter with you two? You’re acting very...odd.

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: This match has been cancelled.
WOOD: We can’t cancel Quidditch.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Silence, Wood. You and your teammates will go to Gryffindor Tower, now. Potter, you and I will find Mr. Weasley. There’s something the both of you have to see.

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: She was found near the Library, along with this. Does it mean anything to either of you?
HARRY: No.

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Could I have your attention please? Because of recent events, these new rules will be put into effect immediately. “All students will return to their house common rooms by six o’clock every evening. All students will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No exceptions.” I should tell you this: unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught, it is likely the school will be closed.
HARRY: We’ve got to talk to Hagrid, Ron. I can’t believe it’s him, but if he did set the monster loose last time, he’ll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets, and that’s a start.
RON: But you heard McGonagall! We’re not allowed to leave the tower except for class.
HARRY: I think it’s time to get my Dad’s old cloak out again.

HAGRID: Who’s there? Hello? Hello?
HARRY: What’s that for?
HAGRID: Oh, nothing. I- I was expecting, ah... It doesn’t matter- come on in- I just made a pot o’ tea.
HARRY: Hagrid, are you okay?
HAGRID: I’m fine! I’m alright.
HARRY: Did you hear about Hermione?
HAGRID: Oh, yeah. I heard about that, all righ’.
HARRY: Look, we have to ask you something. Do you know who’s opened the Chamber of Secrets?
HAGRID: What you had to understand about that is— (knock, knock, knock) Quick under the cloak. Don’t say a word. Be quiet, both o’ you... Professor Dumbledore, sir!
DUMBLEDORE: Good evening, Hagrid. I wonder, could we...?
HAGRID: Of course! Come in! Come in.
RON: That’s Dad’s boss! Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic!
CORNELIUS FUDGE: Bad business, Hagrid. Very bad business. Had to come-- three attacks on Muggle-borns. Things have gone far enough. The Ministry’s got to act.
HAGRID: Oh, but I never- you know I never, Professor!
DUMBLEDORE: I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence.
CORNELIUS FUDGE: Albus look, Hagrid’s record is against him. I’ve got to take him.
HAGRID: Take me? Take me where? Not Azkaban Prison?
CORNELIUS FUDGE: I’m afraid we have no choice, Hagrid.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Already here, Fudge? Good...
HAGRID: What’re you doin’ here? Get outta my house!
LUCIUS MALFOY: Believe me, I take absolutely no pleasure being inside your-- you call this a house? Huh! No. I simply called at the school, and was told the headmaster was here.
DUMBLEDORE: Well, what exactly is it that you want with me?
LUCIUS MALFOY: The other governors and I have decided it’s time for you to step aside. This is an order of suspension. You’ll find all twelve signatures on it. I’m afraid we feel you’ve rather lost your touch. Well, what, with all these attacks, there’ll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts. I can only imagine what an awful loss that would be to the school.
HAGRID: Yeh can’ take Professor Dumbledore away. Take him away, an’ the Muggle-borns won’ stand a chance! You mark my words, there’ll be killin’s next!
LUCIUS MALFOY: You think so?
DUMBLEDORE: Calm yourself, Hagrid. If the governors desire my removal, I will, of course, step aside. However, you will find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Admirable sentiments. Shall we? Fudge!
CORNELIUS FUDGE: Come, Hagrid... Well?
HAGRID: Ahem! If, uh, if anybody was looking for some stuff, then all they’d have to do would be to follow the spiders. Yup! That would lead them right! That’s all I have to say. Oh, and someone’ll need to feed Fang while I’m away.
FANG: (Grrr...)
CORNELIUS FUDGE: Good boy.
RON: Hagrid’s right! With Dumbledore gone, there’ll be an attack a day!
HARRY: Look! Well, come on. Come on, Fang!

RON: Harry, I don’t like this... Harry, I don’t like this at all!
HARRY: Shush!
RON: Can we go back now?
HARRY: Come on!
ARAGOG: Who is it?
HARRY: Don’t panic.
ARAGOG: Hagrid? Is that you?
HARRY: We’re friends of Hagrid’s. And you? Y- y-you’re Aragog aren’t you?
ARAGOG: Yes. Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before.
HARRY: He’s in trouble. Up at the school, there have been attacks. They think it’s Hagrid. They think he opened the Chamber of Secrets, like before.
ARAGOG: That’s a lie! Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets.
HARRY: Then you’re not the monster.
ARAGOG: No! The monster was born in the castle. I came to Hagrid from a distant land, in the pocket of a traveler.
RON: Harry.
HARRY: Shush. But if you’re not the monster, then- then what did kill that girl fifty years ago?
ARAGOG: We do not speak of it. It is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others.
HARRY: But have you seen it?
ARAGOG: I never saw any part of the castle but the box in which Hagrid kept me. The girl was discovered in a bathroom. When I was accused, Hagrid brought me here.
RON: Harry!
HARRY: What?
RON: Ahh- hhh...
----------
Scene 27: Spider attack.
HARRY: Well, thank you. We’ll just...go.
ARAGOG: Go? I think not. My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid on my command. But I cannot deny them fresh meat when it wanders so willingly into our midst. Good-bye, friend of Hagrid.
RON: Can we panic now?
RON: Know any spells?
HARRY: One, but it’s not powerful enough for all of them.
RON: Where’s Hermione when you need her?
HARRY: Let’s go! Arania exumai! Go!
HARRY, RON: Whoah!
RON: Glad we’re out of there. Ah- Aaaah!
HARRY: Arania exumai!
RON: Thanks for that.
HARRY: Don’t mention it. Get us out of here. Now! Come on! Come on! Move faster!
HARRY, RON: Aah!
HARRY: Go on! Go! Get us in the air.
RON: The flying gear’s jammed!
HARRY: Come on! Pull!
RON: I’m trying! RON: Follow the spiders! Follow the spiders! If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban, I’ll kill him! I mean, what was the point of sending us in there? What have we found out?
HARRY: We know one thing. Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets. He was innocent.

LOCATION: Hogwarts - corridor - night
HARRY: ‘Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly than the basilisk. Capable of living for hundreds of years, instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent’s eye. Spiders flee before it.’ Ron, this is it. The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk. That’s why I can hear it speak. It’s a snake!
RON: But if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it no one’s dead? HARRY: Because no one did look it in the eye. Not directly, at least. Colin saw it through his camera. Justin...Justin must have seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick. Nick got the full blast of it- but he’s a ghost- he couldn’t die again. And Hermione...had the mirror. I bet you anything she was using it to look around corners, in case it came along.
RON: And Mrs. Norris? I’m pretty sure she didn’t have a camera or a mirror, Harry.
HARRY: The water. There was water on the floor that night. She only saw the basilisk’s reflection. ‘Spiders flee before it.’ It all fits!
RON: But how’s a basilisk been getting around? A dirty great snake- someone would have seen it.
HARRY: Hermione’s answered that, too.
RON: Pipes? It’s using the plumbing!
HARRY: Remember what Aragog said, about that girl fifty years ago? She died in a bathroom? What if she never left?
RON: Moaning Myrtle.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: All students are to return to their house dormitories at once. All teachers to the second floor corridor, immediately.

PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin has left another message. Our worst fear has been realized. A student has been taken by the monster into the Chamber itself. The students must be sent home. I’m afraid this is the end of Hogwarts.
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: So sorry- dozed off- what have I missed?
SNAPE: A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Your moment has come, at last.
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: My m-moment?
SNAPE: Weren’t you saying just last night that you’ve known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Well, that’s settled. We’ll leave you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy. Your skills, after all, are legend.
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Very well- ah- I’ll just be in my office getting, um- getting ready.
MADAME POMFREY: Who is it that the monster’s taken, Minerva?
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Ginny Weasley.
RON: ‘Her skeleton will lie in the chamber forever.’ Ginny...

PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Uh, ah- well, yes- um, urgent call- unavoidable- got to go.
RON: What about my sister?!
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Well, um- as to that, most unfortunate. No one regrets more than I.
RON: You’re the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher! You can’t go now!
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Well- I must say- when I took the job there was nothing in the job description about a-
HARRY: You’re running away? After all that stuff you did in your books?
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Books can be misleading!
HARRY: You wrote them!
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: My dear boy, do use your common sense! My books wouldn’t have sold half as well if people didn’t think I’d done all those things!
HARRY: You’re a fraud! You’ve just been taking credit for what other wizards have done!
RON: Is there anything you can do?
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Yes, now you mention it. I’m rather gifted with Memory Charms. Otherwise, you see, all those wizards would have gone blabbing. And I’d never have sold another book. In fact, ah...I’m ah...going to have to do the same to you.
HARRY: Don’t even think about it.

MOANING MYRTLE: Oh! Who’s there? Oh! Hello, Harry! Ron. What do you want?
HARRY: To ask you how you died.
MOANING MYRTLE: Oh! It was dreadful. It happened right here in this very cubicle. I’d hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses. I was crying, and then I heard somebody come in.
HARRY: Who was it Myrtle?
MOANING MYRTLE: I don’t know. I was Distraught! Huhh-huh...But they said something funny, a kind of made up language. And I realized it was a boy speaking, so I unlocked the door to tell him to go away and... I died.
HARRY: Just like that? How?
MOANING MYRTLE: I just remember seeing a pair of great big yellow eyes...over there, by that sink. Ohhhhooo...
HARRY: This is it. This is it, Ron. I think this is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.
RON: Say something. Harry, say something in Parseltongue!
HARRY: Hesha- Hassah.
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Excellent, Harry. Haa! Good work! Well then, I’ll just be, ah... There’s no need for me to stay.
HARRY: Oh, yes there is! You first.
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Now, boys what good will it do?
RON: Better you than us.
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Um...but...obviously, yes. Sure you don’t want to test it first? No! Aaaah! It’s really quite filthy down here.
HARRY: All right. Let’s go.
MOANING MYRTLE: Oh, Harry? If you die down there, you’re welcome to share my toilet. Hee, hee.

PROFESSOR LOCKHART: The adventure ends here, boys. But don’t fret. The world will know our story. How I was too late to save the girl. How you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body. So, you first, Mr. Potter. Say good-bye to your memories. Obliviate!
RON: Harry! Harry!
HARRY: Ron! Ron, are you ok?
RON: I’m fine!
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Uhh... Hello. Who are you?
RON: Um...Ron Weasley.
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Really? And uh, who- who am I?
RON: Lockhart’s memory charm backfired. He hasn’t got a clue who he is!
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: It’s an odd sort of place this, isn’t it? Do you live here?
RON: No!
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Really? Well-

HARRY: Ginny... Ginny! Oh, Ginny, please don’t be dead. Wake up. Wake up! Please, wake up!
TOM RIDDLE: She won’t wake.
HARRY: Tom. Tom Riddle! What do you mean, ‘she won’t wake?’ She’s not...?
TOM RIDDLE: She’s still alive, but only just.
HARRY: Are you a ghost?
TOM RIDDLE: A memory, preserved in a diary for fifty years.
HARRY: She’s cold as ice. Ginny, please don’t be dead. Wake up! You’ve got to help me, Tom. There’s a basilisk.
TOM RIDDLE: It won’t come until it’s called.
HARRY: Give me my wand, Tom.
TOM RIDDLE: You won’t be needing it.
HARRY: Listen, we’ve got to go! We’ve got to save her!
TOM RIDDLE: I’m afraid I can’t do that, Harry. You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker, I grow stronger. Yes Harry, it was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets.
HARRY: No. She couldn’t. She wouldn’t!
TOM RIDDLE: It was Ginny who set the basilisk on the Mudbloods and Filch’s cat, Ginny who wrote the threatening messages on the walls.
HARRY: But why?
TOM RIDDLE: Because I told her to. You’ll find that I can be very persuasive. Not that she knew what she was doing. She was, shall we say, in a kind of trance. Still, the power of the diary began to scare her. And she tried to dispose of it in the girl’s bathroom. And then, who should find it, but you? The very person I was most anxious to meet.
HARRY: But, why did you want to meet me?
TOM RIDDLE: I knew I had to talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust.
HARRY: Hagrid’s my friend! And you framed him, didn’t you?
TOM RIDDLE: It was my word against Hagrid’s. Only Dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent.
HARRY: I’ll bet Dumbledore saw right through you.
TOM RIDDLE: He certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that. I knew it wouldn’t be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school, so I decided to leave behind a diary preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that one day I would be able to lead another to finish Salazar Slytherin’s noble work.
HARRY: Well, you haven’t finished it this time. In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught will be ready, and everyone who was Petrified will be all right again.
TOM RIDDLE: Haven’t I told you? Killing Mudbloods doesn’t matter to me anymore. For many months now, my new target... has been you. How is it that a baby, with no extraordinary magical talent, was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort’s powers were destroyed?
HARRY: Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time.
TOM RIDDLE: Voldemort is my past, present, and future. (writes in the air) TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE (rearranges) I AM LORD VOLDEMORT
HARRY: You! You’re the Heir of Slytherin. You’re Voldemort.
TOM RIDDLE: Surely, you didn’t think I was going to keep my filthy Muggle father’s name? No. I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I became the greatest sorcerer in the world.
HARRY: Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!
TOM RIDDLE: Dumbledore’s been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me!
HARRY: He’ll never be gone! Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him! Fawkes?
TOM RIDDLE: So, this is what Dumbledore sends his great defender, a songbird and an old hat. Shearhas- Samnathas- Sélithaeine.

Scene 32: The Basilisk.
TOM RIDDLE: Let’s match the power of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against the famous Harry Potter. Sethae- He- This. Parseltongue won’t save you now, Potter. It only obeys me!
TOM RIDDLE: No! Your bird may have blinded the basilisk, but it can still hear you!
TOM RIDDLE: Yes, Potter, the process is nearly complete. In a few minutes Ginny will be dead, and I will cease to be a memory. Lord Voldemort will return- very... much... alive!
HARRY: Ginny-
----------
Scene 33: Healing powers.
TOM RIDDLE: Remarkable isn’t it, how quickly the venom of the basilisk penetrates the body? I’d guess you have little more than a minute to live. You’ll be with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry. Funny, the damage a silly little book can do... especially in the hands of a silly, little girl. What are you doing? Stop. No! Ahhhh! Ahhhh! Ahhhh!
HARRY: Ginny...
GINNY: Harry. It was me- but I swear, I didn’t mean to! Riddle made me, and... Harry, you’re hurt!
HARRY: Don’t worry. Ginny, you need to get yourself out. Follow the Chamber, and you’ll find Ron. You were brilliant, Fawkes. I just wasn’t quick
enough... Of course! Phoenix tears have healing powers. Thanks! It’s alright, Ginny. It’s over. It’s just a memory.

LOCATION: Hogwarts – Dumbledore’s office - morning
DUMBLEDORE: You both realize, of course, that in the past few hours you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules?
HARRY, RON: Yes, sir.
DUMBLEDORE: And there is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled.
HARRY, RON: Yes, sir.
DUMBLEDORE: Therefore, it is only fitting, that you both receive Special Awards for Services to the School.
RON: Thanks, sir!
DUMBLEDORE: And now, Mr. Weasley, if you would, have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban? I believe we- we want our gamekeeper back. Harry... first, I want to thank you, Harry. You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you. And, um... second, I sense that something is troubling you. Am I right, Harry?
HARRY: It’s just... You see, sir I- I couldn’t help but notice certain things, certain- certain similarities, between Tom Riddle and me.
DUMBLEDORE: I see. Well, you can speak Parseltongue, Harry. Why? Because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue. If I’m not mistaken, Harry, he transferred some of his powers to you the night he gave you that scar.
HARRY: Voldemort transferred some of his powers... to me?
DUMBLEDORE: Not intentionally, but yes.
HARRY: So the Sorting Hat was right! I should be in Slytherin.
DUMBLEDORE: It’s true, Harry. You possess many of the qualities that Voldemort himself prizes. Determination, resourcefulness, and if I may say so, a certain disregard for the rules. Why then did the Sorting Hat place you in Gryffindor?
HARRY: Because I asked it to.
DUMBLEDORE: Exactly, Harry! Exactly! Which makes you different from Voldemort. It is not our abilities that show what we truly are. It is our choices. If you want proof why you belong in Gryffindor, then I suggest that you look more closely at this. Be careful.
HARRY: Godric Gryffindor.
DUMBLEDORE: Ah- it would take a true Gryffindor to pull that out of the hat.

HARRY: Dobby! So this is your master! The family you serve is the Malfoys.
DOBBY: Um-humm...
LUCIUS MALFOY: I’ll deal with you later. Out of my way, Potter! So, it’s true-- you have returned!
DUMBLEDORE: When the governors learned that Arthur Weasley’s daughter was taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Ridiculous!
DUMBLEDORE: Curiously, Lucius, several of them were under the impression that you would curse their families, if they did not agree to suspend me in the first place.
LUCIUS MALFOY: How dare you?!
DUMBLEDORE: I beg your pardon?
LUCIUS MALFOY: My sole concern has always been, and will always be, the welfare of this school and, of course, its students. The culprit has been identified, I presume?
DUMBLEDORE: Oh, yes.
LUCIUS MALFOY: And? Who was it?
DUMBLEDORE: Voldemort.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Ah!
DUMBLEDORE: Only, this time, he chose to act through somebody else, by means of this.
LUCIUS MALFOY: I see.
DUMBLEDORE: Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it. One hopes that no more of Lord Voldemort’s old school things should find their way into innocent hands. The consequences for the one responsible would be severe.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Well, let us hope that Mr. Potter will always be around to save the day.
HARRY: Don’t worry. I will be.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Dumbledore. Come, Dobby. We’re leaving.
DOBBY: Ahh! Oow!
HARRY: Sir, I wonder if I could have that?

HARRY: Mr. Malfoy! Mr. Malfoy! I have something of yours.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Mine? I don’t know what you’re talking about.
HARRY: Oh, I think you do, sir. I think you slipped the diary into Ginny Weasley’s cauldron, that day at Diagon Alley.
LUCIUS MALFOY: You do, do you? Why don’t you prove it? Come, Dobby.
Dobby!
HARRY: Open it.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Dobby?
DOBBY: Master has given Dobby a sock!
LUCIUS MALFOY: What? I didn’t give-
DOBBY: Master has presented Dobby with clothes! Dobby is free!
LUCIUS MALFOY: You’ve lost me my servant!
DOBBY: You shall not harm Harry Potter!
LUCIUS MALFOY: Advada-
LUCIUS MALFOY: Your parents were meddlesome fools, too. You mark my words, Potter, one day soon you are going to meet the same sticky end!
DOBBY: Harry Potter freed Dobby! How can Dobby ever repay him?
HARRY: Just promise me something.
DOBBY: Anything, sir!

HERMIONE: Oh, no!
HAGRID: Sorry I’m late! The owl that delivered my release papers got all lost and confused. Some ruddy bird called Errol. And I’d just like to say that a- if it hadn’t been for you, Harry, and Ron, and Hermione, o’ course, I would- uh- I’d still be you-know-where, so I- I’d just like to say ‘Thanks.’
